Here is our repository for Bangkit 2023 Capstone project 

## Description
The idea of our application is to provide recommendations for environmentally friendly tourist attractions in the categories of culture, nature reserves and marine based on what users like and equipped with a description of tourist attractions, cities, prices and coordinates that can be accessed through Google Maps.

## Content-Based Recommendation System
A recommendation system is a technology used to provide suggestions or recommendations to users based on their preferences, behaviors, or gathered information about them. The main goal of a recommendation system is to assist users in discovering relevant and interesting content or products.

This system analyzes the existing content or attributes of products, such as descriptions, categories, or rating, and matches user preferences with similar content. For example, if a user shows an interest in tourist attractions with cultural category, the system will recommend other tourist attractions with cultural category that are similar.
